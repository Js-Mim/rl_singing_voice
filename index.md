We present a method for learning interpretable music signal representations directly from waveform signals. Our method can be trained using unsupervised objectives and relies on the denoising auto-encoder model that uses a simple sinusoidal model as decoding functions to reconstruct the singing voice. 
The supplementary material focuses on three "qualitative" aspects:
* Audio examples of reconstructed music signals
* Visual examples of the representation
* Visual examples of frequency responses

# Audio examples

# Visual examples

# Frequency responses
We used the best performing model, reported in our paper, and compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the
resulting basis signals, that the decoder is is using.
